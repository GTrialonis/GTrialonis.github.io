                For a Moment I Thought …
by [Your Name]

For a moment I thought
it was a butterfly —
the yellow and orange leaf
that took flight from the swishing poplar trees
across my balcony.

It swayed and fluttered in excitement,
here and there, up and down,
undecided —
should it go left or right,
to the ground or up to the sky?
Should I stay, or should I go?

What to make of perceived options
when you lose your wings to know
that gravity always wins?
And ultimately, to the ground —
with or without wings.
